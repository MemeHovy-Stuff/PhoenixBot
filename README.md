To run SylveonBot, you will need a pc with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed. If you plan on making your bot public, you should use a virtual private server (vps) instead. In this case, the most popular choice (based off [this article](https://hostadvice.com/discord-bot-hosting/)) would be [Kamatera](https://www.kamatera.com/), which starts at $4 USD.
